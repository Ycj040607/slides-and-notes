# slides-and-notes
The repository is build to present academic slides and notes I have made as a TA, or during seminars, other lectures and courses.

# SCUPI 
Serving as a TA for the course CS0441 Discrete Structures for CS, MATH0240 Analytic Geometry and Calculus, MATH0290 Differential Equations, ECE1110 Computer Organization and Architecture (updating).
Tutorial Slides (half of them due to collaborating with another TA), Assignment Solutions (self-made, if possible) and other relevant materials are presented.

For MATH0290 Differential Equations, the course starts from the very beginning of DEs, and the deepest stage reaches laplace transform and fourier series, mostly talking about ODEs.

Serving as the host and speaker for "Seminar in Mathematics". Relevant materials are uploaded for record and reference.

Serving as a (pseudo-) research assistant.
