# My Research Interest
AI Cognition Thoery, Mathematics with AI, Fundamental Theory of Computer Science

# AI Cognition Theory
I always believe that the boundaries of neuroscience and psychology determine the boundary of artificial intelligence. I have been fascinated by them since I was young. After learning computer science, I think we have the possibility of touching the essence of intelligence, but the existing theories are far from enough.

# Mathematics with AI
The purity of mathematics really moves me. As Terence Tao claims, this field like Lean4 is emergent.

# Fundamental Thoery of Computer Science
Inspired by Avi Wigderson and the enthusiasm to study on thoery over engineering, I would love to try on this field to see if I can make a micro contribution.
